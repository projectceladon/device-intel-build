# This provides the 'publish' and 'publish_ci' makefile targets.
#
# PUBLISH target:
# 	NOTE: When using the 'publish' target you MUST also use the 'dist'
# 	target.  The 'dist' target is a special target and unfortunately we
# 	can't just depend on the 'dist' target :(
# 	   e.g. 'make dist publish'
# 	   e.g. 'make droid dist publish'
#
# 	DO NOT DO: 'make publish' as it will not work
#
# PUBLISH_CI target:
# 	The 'publish_ci' target may be called by itself as it has a dependency
# 	on the one file we need.
# 	   e.g. 'make publish_ci'
